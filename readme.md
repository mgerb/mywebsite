# Golang Site Implementation

I have been working on converting my entire website over to the Go programming language. Along with doing this I have also converted the front end entirely to AngularJS. MongoDB is still used and the data base queries have been more optimized.

I have also made this project open source. Passwords are no longer stored in the code. Rename "config-template.json" to "config.json" to start the server.

# Edit 10/19/2016 - This is a deprecated version of my site

I've more recently redone this site using react as a front end framework rather than Angular. Check out the [react](https://github.com/mgerb/mywebsite/tree/react) branch.
