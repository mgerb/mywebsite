# A new branch to rebuild this entire application using:

- ReactJS
- Go App Engine

`npm run build` - builds the application using webpack and runs metadata.js
`npm run 
- metadata.js recursivly scans the posts folder for markdown files and then parses each into into a json object
- the posts folder is then copied into the dist folder

## TODO
- sticky footer
- clean up css
- adjust animations

- fix go and webpack-dev-server so paths work correctly
- add sensor page
- add paging

- finally do writeups on my projects
