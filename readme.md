# A new branch to rebuild this entire application using:

- ReactJS
- Go App Engine

`npm run build` - builds the application using webpack and runs metadata.js

- metadata.js recursivly scans the posts folder for markdown files and then parses each into into a json object
- the posts folder is then copied into the dist folder

## TODO
- fix font sizing
- clean up css
- adjust animations

- fix goapp serve and webpack-dev-server so paths work correctly
- posts page
- add sensor page
- finally do writeups on my projects
- clean go code up
- host on app engine (run mongodb on compute engine???)
- pull everything off digital ocean
- add paging
