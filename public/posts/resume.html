		<h2>Mitchell Gerber</h2>

		<p>Hello, my name is Mitchell and I am pursuing a career in software development. I have a passion for creating things and learning new technologies.
		</p>

		<p>I always find enjoyment in building things, whether it's computers, drones, or software. I started programming upon entering college and I have been hooked ever since. Programming has become a hobby of mine and it has opened up many oppurtunities.
		</p>

		<p>My primary strengths include back end development and working with MySQL databases. I've also worked with MongoDB as well as development on the client side. I helped develop a web application for Digi International that is used to debug embedded devices for testing purposes. I worked with Java/JSP, which ran on a Jetty web server and used an H2 SQL database.
		</p>

		<p>My interest in developing things follows me home after work hours. I often lose track of time working on personal projects. I'm currently working on this personal website to learn Node.js and familiarize myself with newer web development technologies. In my free time I enjoy building and flying radio controlled unmanned aerial systems. I've also recently gained an interest in programming microcontrollers.

		<h2>Technical Skills</h2>

		<p>I started with Java and have been working with it since the end of 2012. I consider myself experienced in Java as I have used it for numerous projects throughout college as well as at my job as a Software Tester/Developer. I found my interest in web development in late 2014. Since then I've become familiar with different back end languages including Node.js, PHP, and Java. I've also worked with MongoDB as well as relational databases such as MySQL.
		</p>

		<p>Beginning of Summer 2015 I started venturing into the category of microcontrollers. I've become familiar with programming the Arduino as well as a microcontroller called the ESP8266. Throughout this process I've gained knowledge of working with C.
		</p>

		<p>As of late 2014 I've been using Linux as my primary operating system for software development, which has allowed me to become more familiar with Unix systems. I've also worked with Ubuntu server, which is used to host this website.
		</p>
