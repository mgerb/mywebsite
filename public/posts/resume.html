	<h2>Mitchell Gerber</h2>

	<p>Hello, my name is Mitchell and I am persuing a career in software development. I have a passion for learning new technologies and I'm always striving to find a way to make something better.
	</p>

	<p>I always find enjoyment in building things, whether it's computers, drones, or software. I started programming upon enrolling in college and I have been hooked ever since. Programming has become a hobby of mine and it has opened up many oppurtunities.
	</p>

	<p>My primary strengths include back end development and working with MySQL databases. I also have experience with NoSQL databases and front end development. I helped develop a web application for Digi International that is used to debug embedded devices for testing purposes. I worked with Java/JSP, which ran on a Jetty web server and used an H2 embedded database.
	</p>

	<p>Software development doesn't stop when I leave work. I often lose track of time working on personal projects in my free time. I'm currently developing this personal website to learn Node.js and familiarize myself with newer web development technologies.
