    <p><span class="colorRed">Note:</span> I am using a DHT11 analog sensor for both temperature and humidity readings. I am also using a DS18B20 digital sensor, which only takes temperature readings. The digital sensor seems to get more accurate readings. Some of the data may be inconsistent as this is an experimental process.
